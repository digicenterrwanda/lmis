Using and developing query managers
-----------------------------------

Query managers are used in <query> tags to execute queries which can be used in charts.

SAV Charts extension comes with an internal query manager named "savcharts" which can
deal with TYPO3 database queries as well as queries from other databases.

Using the query manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the backend in list mode create a new record in a page or a folder.

.. figure:: ../../Images/Tutorial/InternalQueryManager.png

Select "Database" if you need to access to an external database, fill the different fields and save.

.. tip::

    You do not need to create a new database access if you only need to access to the current TYPO3 database.

.. figure:: ../../Images/Tutorial/InternalQueryManagerNewDatabase.png

Select "Query" to create a query. Select a database (default is TYPO3 Database), fill the different clauses and save. 

The following figure illustrates the query to display the number of pages per year.

.. figure:: ../../Images/Tutorial/InternalQueryManagerNewQuery.png

Assuming that the new query has the id "1", the following flexform configuration displays a bar chart with the 
number of pages per year. 

.. figure:: ../../Images/Tutorial/barChartWithQueryFlexformConfiguration.png

In the "Queries" section, the default query manager "savcharts" is used. It calls the query whose uid is 1.

The "Data" section of the flexform overloads the template to display only a single barchart
with the data provided by the query, as explained in the section :ref:`usingAdvancedTemplates`.


.. important::

    The flag "Allow queries (Admin)" must be set by an Admin user in the content 
    flexform to execute queries.

Go to the frontend to display the resulting chart.

Developing your query manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Query managers are implemented by means of hooks.The hook for the internal query manager 
is in "Classes/Hooks/SavChartsQueryManager.php". This class extends the abstract class 
AbstractQueryManager ("Classes/Hooks/AbstractQueryManager.php")
which itself implements the interface QueryManagerInterface ("Classes/Hooks/QueryManagerInterface.php").

You can develop your own query manager by providing a hook which must be added in the  file "ext_localconf.php"
of your extension. 

Assuming that your vendor name is "MyVendorName" and your extension name is "my_extension". Assuming also 
that you have written your manager as the class MyQueryManager in "Classes/Hooks/MyQueryManager.php". 
Finally, assuming that you want to name your query manager "myManager", you should add 
the following code in "ext_localconf.php" of your extension.

.. code::

    $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['EXTCONF'][$_EXTKEY]['queryManagerClass']['myManager'] = 'EXT:' . $_EXTKEY .
        '/Classes/Hooks/MyQueryManager.php:MyVendorName\\MyExtension\\Hooks\\MyQueryManager';
